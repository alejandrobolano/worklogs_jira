## Using

Firstly, before using it, you must go to the settings section and insert the username and password, and then save it. **These data are not stored in plain text**. Afterwards, a message will appear confirming that the authorization is saved, allowing you to use it within the application.

On the main screen, you can:

* Insert a task and click the refresh button with the associated icon to perform a 'get' operation and view the related work.
* Insert a task + start date (it shouldn't be Saturday or Sunday) + hours worked + repetition (default: 1). This way, you can log that task, and it will repeat based on the specified repetition.
* See different items about the task, like owner, timespent, and other.

* To see all issues logged between some range.
* To see different charts and to appreciate all issues graphically.
